Absolutely! Here are **clear explanations with examples** for each of the commonly asked Node.js basics, as well as notes on interview questions.

## 1. **What is Node.js and how does it work?**

### **Explanation**
- **Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server (i.e., outside the browser).
- Built on **Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine**.
- Features a **single-threaded, non-blocking, event-driven architecture**—ideal for building fast and scalable network applications.

### **In Interviews, you can say:**
> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 engine, provides an event-driven architecture, and supports non-blocking I/O, making it suitable for real-time and scalable applications.

## 2. **Node.js architecture (Event loop, Non-blocking I/O model)**

### **Explanation**
- Node.js uses a **single-threaded event loop** for handling concurrent operations.
- Instead of multiple threads handling I/O, it uses **callbacks, promises, and events**.
- Non-blocking: While one operation waits (e.g., for file reading), Node.js can process other code.

### **In interviews:**
> Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop that handles multiple clients concurrently. Rather than using threads for each client (like traditional servers), Node.js places tasks like I/O operations in the event queue, and processes them asynchronously using callbacks/events, which makes it non-blocking and efficient.

### **Example:**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Non-blocking/asynchronous file read:
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data); // Output when read is complete
});

console.log('Reading file...'); // This runs before file reading completes
```

**Output:**
```
Reading file...
[file contents]
```
The order shows that reading the file does **not** block execution.

## 3. **REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) basics**

### **Explanation**
- **REPL** is an interactive shell for Node.js—stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop.
- It reads your input, evaluates it, prints the result, then loops again.
- Great for experimenting with code snippets or debugging.

### **How to run:**
- In terminal, write: `node`
- Now, you’re in REPL mode.

### **Example:**

```bash
$ node
> 2 + 2
4
> const name = 'Alice'
undefined
> name
'Alice'
> .exit
```

**Interview Tip:**  
> The Node.js REPL is a command-line tool for running JavaScript expressions interactively, which helps in quick experimentation and debugging.

## 4. **Node.js process object (process.argv, process.env, etc.)**

### **Explanation**
- `process` is a global object in Node.js, giving info about the current running Node process.

#### **Common properties:**
- `process.argv`: Array containing command-line arguments.
- `process.env`: Object containing environment variables.
- `process.exit()`: Ends the Node process.

### **Example:**

```javascript
// test.js
console.log('Command line arguments:', process.argv);
console.log('NODE_ENV:', process.env.NODE_ENV);
```

**Run it:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production node test.js hello 123
```

**Sample output:**
```
Command line arguments: [
  '/usr/local/bin/node',
  '/your/path/test.js',
  'hello',
  '123'
]
NODE_ENV: production
```
> The first two entries are the path to the node executable and the script file. The rest are user inputs.  
> You can set environment variables (like `NODE_ENV`) and access them in the app.

**Interview Summary:**
> The `process` object allows access to information about the current Node.js process, including arguments (`process.argv`), environment variables (`process.env`), and methods to control execution (`process.exit()`).

### **Common Interview Questions Based on Above Topics**

**Q: What makes Node.js different from other server-side technologies?**  
A: Its single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking architecture allows handling many connections efficiently.

**Q: What is non-blocking I/O?**  
A: I/O operations (like file reads) don’t block the event loop; Node.js uses callbacks/events to handle results when ready.

**Q: How do you access command-line arguments in a Node.js script?**  
A: Using `process.argv`, which returns an array of all CLI arguments.

**Q: What is the use of REPL in Node.js?**  
A: It's an interactive shell for running and testing snippets quickly.
