Here is a mind map summarizing the key concepts of Java Multithreading as presented in the provided video transcript:

# Java Multithreading: A Mind Map

## I. **Core Concepts & Foundations**
*   **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
    *   Brain of the computer
    *   Where programs run
    *   Examples: Intel, AMD
*   **Core**
    *   An individual processing unit within a CPU
    *   CPU contains cores; processing happens inside cores
    *   More cores = more tasks concurrently
    *   Example: Quad-core processor means 4 cores, can do 4 tasks simultaneously
*   **Program**
    *   Set of instructions
    *   Examples: Microsoft Word, OBS Studio
*   **Process**
    *   An instance of a program
    *   When a program runs, the Operating System (OS) starts a corresponding process
    *   Example: Opening Microsoft Word starts a Word process
*   **Thread**
    *   **Smallest unit of execution within a process**
    *   A process can have multiple threads
    *   Threads within the same process share some resources but can run independently
    *   Examples:
        *   Microsoft Word: Typing, spell checker, auto-save are separate threads
        *   Web Browser (Google Chrome): Each tab or task (rendering page, JavaScript, user inputs) can be a separate thread
    *   **Lightweight process**
    *   **Main Thread:** Automatically created and runs when a Java program starts, responsible for `main` method execution

## II. **Multitasking vs. Multithreading**
*   **Multitasking**
    *   **Allows an OS to run multiple processes simultaneously**
    *   **Higher-level concept** (manages processes)
    *   **Single-Core CPU:** Achieved through **time-sharing** and **rapid switching** between tasks (illusion of parallelism)
    *   **Multi-Core CPU:** **True parallel execution** occurs by distributing tasks across cores
    *   **Example:** Running internet browser, listening to music, downloading files concurrently
    *   **Enhances CPU/core capabilities** by assigning different tasks to different cores
*   **Multithreading**
    *   **Ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently**
    *   **Lower-level, more granular concept** (manages threads within a process)
    *   **Enhances the efficiency of multitasking** by breaking down individual tasks into smaller sub-tasks (threads) that can be processed simultaneously
    *   **Java Multithreading:** Concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize CPU utilization
        *   Utilizes `java.lang` package
        *   **JVM** assists OS in managing threads, especially in multi-core environments for true parallel execution
    *   **Example:** A web browser using separate threads for rendering, JavaScript, and user input to be more responsive
*   **Relationship:** Multitasking can be achieved through multithreading
*   **Resource Management:**
    *   **Multitasking:** Manages resources between separate programs (potentially different memory spaces)
    *   **Multithreading:** Manages resources within a single process
*   **Context Switching:** Process of saving the state of a running process/thread and loading the next one to be executed
*   **Time Slicing (Quantum):** Dividing CPU time into small intervals allocated to different processes/threads, ensuring fair execution based on priority

## III. **Thread Creation & Lifecycle**
*   **Creating New Threads in Java**
    *   **Extend `Thread` Class**
        1.  Create a new class and extend `Thread`
        2.  Override the `run()` method with the code for the new thread
        3.  Create an object of the new class
        4.  Call the `start()` method on the object (this calls `run()` in a new thread)
        5.  **Use Case:** When your class doesn't need to extend any other class
    *   **Implement `Runnable` Interface**
        1.  Create a new class and implement `Runnable`
        2.  Override the `run()` method
        3.  Create an instance of your `Runnable` class
        4.  Create a `Thread` object, passing the `Runnable` instance to its constructor
        5.  Call the `start()` method on the `Thread` object
        6.  **Use Case:** When your class already extends another class (Java doesn't support multiple inheritance for classes)
*   **Thread Lifecycle (States)**
    *   **New:** When a thread object is created but `start()` has not yet been called
    *   **Runnable:** After `start()` is called; thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time
        *   Java's `Thread.State.RUNNABLE` covers both "ready to run" and "currently executing"
    *   **Running:** When the thread is actively executing on the CPU (not a distinct state in Java's `Thread.State` enum)
    *   **Blocked / Waiting:** Thread is temporarily inactive, waiting for a resource, another thread, or an event
        *   **Timed Waiting:** A specific type of waiting where the thread waits for a specified time (e.g., `Thread.sleep()`)
    *   **Terminated:** When the thread has finished executing its `run()` method

## IV. **Thread Methods**
*   **`start()`:** Initiates the execution of the thread by calling its `run()` method in a new thread of execution
*   **`run()`:** Contains the code that constitutes the new thread's execution
*   **`sleep(long milliseconds)`:** Suspends the execution of the current thread for a specified period
    *   Throws `InterruptedException` (checked exception)
*   **`join()`:** Causes the current thread to wait for another thread to finish its execution
*   **`setPriority(int priority)` & `getPriority()`:** Sets/gets the priority of a thread (values 1-10, `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY`, `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY`, `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`)
    *   **Hint to OS/JVM Scheduler:** Not a strict guarantee of execution order
*   **`setName(String name)` & `getName()`:** Sets/gets the name of a thread
*   **`interrupt()`:** Interrupts the thread, often used to unblock it from a waiting state (e.g., `sleep()`, `join()`)
    *   Sets the interrupt status of the thread
*   **`yield()`:** A hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to give up its current use of the processor to allow other threads to run
*   **`setDaemon(boolean on)`:** Marks the thread as a daemon thread
    *   **User Threads:** Perform actual work/business logic; JVM waits for them to complete
    *   **Daemon Threads:** Run in the background (e.g., Garbage Collector); JVM does **not** wait for them to complete before exiting
        *   If all user threads terminate, JVM exits, even if daemon threads are still running

## V. **Synchronization & Locks**
*   **Race Condition**
    *   Occurs when multiple threads access and modify shared resources concurrently, and the outcome depends on the unpredictable timing of their execution
    *   Leads to inconsistent or incorrect results
*   **Critical Section**
    *   The part of a program where shared resources are accessed or modified
    *   Needs protection to prevent race conditions
*   **Mutual Exclusion**
    *   Ensures that only one thread can access a critical section at any given time
    *   Prevents simultaneous access to shared resources by multiple threads
*   **`synchronized` Keyword (Intrinsic Locks)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Built-in locking mechanism in Java
    *   Applied to:
        *   **Methods:** Locks the object instance (for instance methods) or the class (for static methods)
        *   **Code Blocks:** Locks a specific object provided in the block (e.g., `synchronized(this)`)
    *   **Ensures Mutual Exclusion:** Only one thread can execute a synchronized method/block on a given object at a time
    *   **Disadvantages of `synchronized`:**
        *   **Indefinite Blocking:** A thread might wait indefinitely for a lock
        *   **No Fairness Guarantee:** No specific order for acquiring locks
        *   **Not Interruptible:** A waiting thread cannot be interrupted
        *   **No Read/Write Distinction:** Blocks all operations (read and write) equally, leading to unnecessary blocking for read operations
*   **Explicit Locks (`java.util.concurrent.locks` Package)**
    *   More advanced and flexible than `synchronized`
    *   Provides more control over locking behavior
    *   **`Lock` Interface:**
        *   **`ReentrantLock` (Implementation Class):**
            *   **Reentrancy:** A thread that already holds the lock can acquire it again without deadlocking itself (maintains an internal count)
            *   **Methods:**
                *   **`lock()`:** Acquires the lock, blocking indefinitely if it's unavailable (similar to `synchronized`)
                *   **`unlock()`:** Releases the lock; must be called in a `finally` block to ensure release
                *   **`tryLock()`:** Attempts to acquire the lock immediately; returns `true` if successful, `false` otherwise (non-blocking)
                *   **`tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)`:** Attempts to acquire the lock within a specified waiting time; returns `true` if successful, `false` otherwise (timed-blocking)
                *   **`lockInterruptibly()`:** Acquires the lock unless the current thread is interrupted while waiting
            *   **Fairness:** Can be constructed as `new ReentrantLock(true)` to provide a fair locking policy (FIFO)
                *   Prevents **starvation** (where a thread never gets a chance to acquire the lock)
    *   **`ReadWriteLock` Interface:**
        *   **`ReentrantReadWriteLock` (Implementation Class):**
            *   **Purpose:** Allows multiple threads to **read** resources concurrently, but ensures **exclusive access for write operations**
            *   **Mechanism:** Provides a `readLock()` and `writeLock()`
                *   **Read Lock:** Can be acquired by multiple threads simultaneously *as long as no thread holds the write lock*
                *   **Write Lock:** Exclusive; only one thread can hold it, and no read locks can be active when it's held
            *   **Advantage:** Overcomes the unnecessary blocking of `synchronized` for read operations

## VI. **Deadlock**
*   **Definition:** A situation where two or more threads are permanently blocked, waiting for each other to release resources
*   **Four Conditions for Deadlock:**
    1.  **Mutual Exclusion:** Resources cannot be shared
    2.  **Hold and Wait:** A thread holds at least one resource and waits for another
    3.  **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread
    4.  **Circular Wait:** A circular chain of threads exists, where each thread waits for a resource held by the next
*   **Example:** Thread A has Pen, needs Paper; Thread B has Paper, needs Pen
*   **Resolution Strategy:**
    *   **Consistent Lock Ordering:** Ensure all threads acquire locks in the same predefined sequence

## VII. **Thread Communication**
*   **Problem without Communication:** **Busy Waiting** – threads continuously check for conditions, wasting CPU resources and potentially leading to deadlocks
    *   Example: Consumer constantly checking if data is available from Producer
*   **Solution:** `Object.wait()`, `Object.notify()`, `Object.notifyAll()` methods
    *   **Context:** These methods **must** be called within a `synchronized` context (method or block)
    *   **`wait()`:**
        *   Causes the current thread to release the lock on the object and go into a waiting state.
        *   Waits until another thread invokes `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object.
    *   **`notify()`:**
        *   Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
    *   **`notifyAll()`:**
        *   Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.
    *   **Example (Producer-Consumer):** Producer `wait()`s if buffer is full, `notify()`s consumer when data is produced; Consumer `wait()`s if buffer is empty, `notify()`s producer when data is consumed

## VIII. **Thread Safety**
*   **Definition:** An object or code is **thread-safe** if it guarantees correct behavior (no unexpected results, race conditions, or data corruption) when accessed by multiple threads concurrently
*   All synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized`, Locks, `wait`/`notify`) are used to achieve thread safety

## IX. **Lambda Expressions**
*   **Anonymous Functions:** Functions without a name
*   **Simplifies Thread Creation:** Can be used to implement `Runnable` or `Callable` interfaces concisely
*   **Functional Interfaces:** Interfaces with a **single abstract method** (e.g., `Runnable`, `Callable`)
    *   Lambda expressions provide a compact way to implement these interfaces
*   **Syntax:** `(parameters) -> { body }`
    *   Can omit parameter types and parentheses for a single parameter
    *   Can omit curly braces and `return` keyword for a single-line body

## X. **Executors Framework (Java 5+)**
*   **Purpose:** Simplifies development of concurrent applications by abstracting thread creation and management complexities
*   **Problems without Executors Framework:**
    *   **Manual Thread Management:** Leads to poor resource management
    *   **Scalability Issues:** System might fail under heavy load
    *   **Overhead:** Frequent creation/destruction of threads is expensive
    *   **Complex Error Handling:** Manual management increases complexity
*   **Core Interfaces:**
    1.  **`Executor`:** Basic interface for executing tasks (single `execute(Runnable command)` method)
    2.  **`ExecutorService`:** Extends `Executor`, provides methods for managing the lifecycle of tasks and the executor itself (e.g., shutdown)
    3.  **`ScheduledExecutorService`:** Extends `ExecutorService`, for scheduling tasks to run after a delay or periodically
*   **`Executors` Utility Class:** Factory methods to create various types of `ExecutorService`
    *   **`newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads)`:**
        *   Creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads.
        *   Threads are reused.
        *   Good for tasks with known, consistent load.
    *   **`newSingleThreadExecutor()`:**
        *   Creates an `ExecutorService` that uses a single worker thread.
        *   Tasks are executed sequentially.
    *   **`newCachedThreadPool()`:**
        *   Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed.
        *   Terminates idle threads after 60 seconds of inactivity.
        *   **Dynamic pool size.**
        *   **Use Case:** When load is **variable** and tasks are **short-lived**.
    *   **`newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize)`:**
        *   For delayed and periodic task execution.
*   **`ExecutorService` Methods:**
    *   **`submit(Runnable task)`:** Submits a `Runnable` task for execution; returns a `Future<?>`
    *   **`submit(Callable<T> task)`:** Submits a `Callable` task; returns a `Future<T>`
    *   **`submit(Runnable task, T result)`:** Submits a `Runnable` task; returns a `Future<T>` that will return the given `result` upon successful completion
    *   **`shutdown()`:** Initiates an **orderly shutdown**. No new tasks are accepted, but previously submitted tasks are completed.
    *   **`shutdownNow()`:** Attempts to **stop all actively executing tasks**, halts the processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of tasks that were awaiting execution.
    *   **`awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`:** Blocks until all tasks complete execution after a shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is interrupted (whichever happens first).
    *   **`isShutdown()`:** Returns `true` if this executor has been shut down.
    *   **`isTerminated()`:** Returns `true` if all tasks have completed following a shutdown.
    *   **`invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks)`:** Executes all given tasks, returning a list of `Future`s. Blocks until all tasks are completed (or the optional timeout expires).
    *   **`invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks)`:** Executes the given tasks, returning the result of one that completes successfully (first one). Other uncompleted tasks are cancelled.
*   **`Callable` vs. `Runnable`:**
    *   **`Runnable`:**
        *   `run()` method does not return a result.
        *   `run()` method cannot throw checked exceptions.
    *   **`Callable<V>`:**
        *   `call()` method returns a result of type `V`.
        *   `call()` method can throw checked exceptions.
*   **`Future<T>` Interface:**
    *   Represents the result of an asynchronous computation.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **`get()`:** Blocks indefinitely until the task is completed and returns its result (or throws an exception).
        *   **`get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`:** Blocks until the task is completed or the timeout expires.
        *   **`isDone()`:** Returns `true` if the task completed (normally, exceptionally, or by cancellation).
        *   **`isCancelled()`:** Returns `true` if the task was cancelled before it completed normally.
        *   **`cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)`:** Attempts to cancel the execution of this task.

## XI. **ScheduledExecutorService Methods**
*   **`schedule(Runnable command, long delay, TimeUnit unit)`:**
    *   Executes a `Runnable` task once after the specified `delay`.
*   **`schedule(Callable<V> callable, long delay, TimeUnit unit)`:**
    *   Executes a `Callable` task once after the specified `delay`; returns a `ScheduledFuture<V>`.
*   **`scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit)`:**
    *   Executes a task periodically at a fixed rate. The `period` is measured from the start of the previous execution, **regardless of how long the task itself takes.**
    *   **Overlapping executions can occur** if task execution time exceeds the period.
*   **`scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long delay, TimeUnit unit)`:**
    *   Executes a task periodically with a fixed delay between the completion of one execution and the start of the next.
    *   **No overlapping executions.**

## XII. **Advanced Thread Coordination Utilities**
*   **`CountDownLatch`**
    *   **Purpose:** Allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations (or tasks) being performed in other threads completes.
    *   **Constructor:** `CountDownLatch(int count)` – initialized with the number of events to wait for.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **`countDown()`:** Decrements the count.
        *   **`await()`:** Blocks the current thread until the count reaches zero.
    *   **Simplicity:** Offers a straightforward way to achieve simple thread synchronization.
    *   **Limitation:** **Not reusable** – once the count reaches zero, it cannot be reset.
*   **`CyclicBarrier`**
    *   **Purpose:** Enables multiple threads to wait for each other at a common "barrier" point. Once all threads reach the barrier, they are all released simultaneously.
    *   **Constructor:** `CyclicBarrier(int parties)` – initialized with the number of threads (parties) that must reach the barrier.
    *   **`CyclicBarrier(int parties, Runnable barrierAction)`:** An optional `Runnable` action that runs once, when the last thread arrives at the barrier, before the threads are released.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **`await()`:** Threads call this method to wait at the barrier. Blocks until all `parties` have invoked `await()`.
        *   **`reset()`:** Resets the barrier to its initial state, making it **reusable**.
    *   **Use Case:** Ideal for scenarios where a group of threads needs to perform a series of interdependent steps, and all threads must complete one step before any can proceed to the next.
    *   **Does not block the main thread** by default.

## XIII. **CompletableFuture (Java 8+)**
*   **Purpose:** Introduced for **asynchronous programming** and easily **chaining dependent asynchronous tasks**
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Non-blocking execution, where a task runs in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue without waiting
*   **Creation Methods:**
    *   **`CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier)`:** Runs the `supplier` task asynchronously and returns a `CompletableFuture` holding its result.
    *   **`CompletableFuture.runAsync(Runnable runnable)`:** Runs the `runnable` task asynchronously; returns a `CompletableFuture<Void>`.
    *   Can optionally specify an `Executor` for task execution, providing control over thread management
*   **Retrieving Results & Waiting:**
    *   **`get()`:** Blocks indefinitely until the computation is complete and returns the result (throws checked `ExecutionException`).
    *   **`join()`:** Similar to `get()`, but throws an unchecked `CompletionException` if the computation completes exceptionally.
    *   **`getNow(T valueIfAbsent)`:** Returns the result if available, otherwise returns the provided `valueIfAbsent` (non-blocking).
*   **Chaining & Transformation:**
    *   **`thenApply(Function<? super T,? extends U> fn)`:** Applies a function to the result of the `CompletableFuture` when it completes; returns a new `CompletableFuture`.
    *   **`exceptionally(Function<Throwable, ? extends T> fn)`:** Handles exceptions that occur during computation.
*   **Combination:**
    *   **`CompletableFuture.allOf(CompletableFuture<?>... cfs)`:** Returns a new `CompletableFuture<Void>` that is completed when all the given `CompletableFuture`s complete.
    *   **`CompletableFuture.anyOf(CompletableFuture<?>... cfs)`:** Returns a new `CompletableFuture<Object>` that is completed when any of the given `CompletableFuture`s completes.
*   **Timeouts:** Can apply timeouts to `CompletableFuture` operations.
*   **Flexibility & Control:** Highly flexible for managing complex asynchronous workflows.
