### Explained Notes on Java's `CompletableFuture`

**1. Introduction to `CompletableFuture` and Asynchronous Programming**
`CompletableFuture` was **introduced in Java 8** to handle **asynchronous programming**. Asynchronous programming is a broader term that essentially means **multi-threading is used to achieve non-blocking behavior**.
In a synchronous execution, statements run line by line, and the main thread waits for each statement to complete before moving to the next. In contrast, `CompletableFuture` enables **asynchronous or non-blocking execution**, where a task can run in a separate thread, allowing the **main thread to continue its work without waiting** for that task to finish.

**Core Idea**: If a statement (e.g., `statement two`) takes a long time, `CompletableFuture` allows it to run in a separate thread so the main thread doesn't have to wait.

**2. Basic Usage: Running Asynchronous Tasks with `supplyAsync`**
`CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` is a key method to run a task asynchronously. You pass a `Lambda Expression` to it, which can perform any operation, such as a `Thread.sleep()` or a computation that returns a result.

*   **Default Behavior (Non-Blocking)**: By default, the task submitted to `supplyAsync()` runs in a **daemon thread**. This means the **main thread will not wait for its completion**, and the program might terminate before the asynchronous task finishes if the main thread completes its work quickly.
*   **Return Type**: `supplyAsync()` returns a `CompletableFuture` object, which will eventually hold the result of the asynchronous computation.

**Conceptual Coding Example 1: Non-Blocking Asynchronous Task**
```java
// 1. Create a CompletableFuture that runs a task asynchronously
CompletableFuture<String> workerFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    System.out.println("Worker thread: Task started. Waiting for 5 seconds...");
    try {
        Thread.sleep(5000); // Simulate a long-running task
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
    System.out.println("Worker thread: Task finished.");
    return "Worker Task Result";
});

System.out.println("Main thread: Continuing its work without waiting.");

// The main thread will print its message and might terminate
// before the worker thread finishes, as workerFuture is a daemon thread by default.
// To see the worker print, the main thread needs to wait (see next example).
```
**Explanation**: In this example, "Main thread: Continuing its work..." will print almost immediately because `supplyAsync()` starts the `Thread.sleep(5000)` in a separate thread, and the main thread doesn't wait. If the main thread had no further work, the program might exit before "Worker thread: Task finished." is printed, because daemon threads don't prevent JVM termination.

**3. Waiting for Results: `get()` and `join()`**
If the main thread needs the result of the asynchronous task, it must wait for its completion. This can be done using `get()` or `join()`.

*   **`get()`**: This method makes the **main thread wait** until the `CompletableFuture` completes and then returns its result. It **throws checked exceptions** (`InterruptedException`, `ExecutionException`), so it typically needs to be wrapped in a `try-catch` block.
*   **`join()`**: Similar to `get()`, `join()` also waits for the task to complete and returns the result. The key difference is that `join()` **throws unchecked exceptions** (specifically, `CompletionException`), so it does not require a `try-catch` block.

**Conceptual Coding Example 2: Blocking and Getting Result with `get()`**
```java
CompletableFuture<String> workerFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    System.out.println("Worker thread: Task started. Waiting for 5 seconds...");
    try {
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
    return "Worker Task Result";
});

System.out.println("Main thread: Initiated worker task.");

try {
    // Main thread now waits for the workerFuture to complete.
    String result = workerFuture.get(); // This is a blocking call.
    System.out.println("Main thread: Received result from worker -> " + result); //
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    System.err.println("Main thread: Error while getting result: " + e.getMessage());
}
System.out.println("Main thread: Completed all operations.");
```
**Explanation**: Now, "Main thread: Received result..." will only print after the 5-second `Thread.sleep` in the worker task has completed, because `workerFuture.get()` blocks the main thread.

**Conceptual Coding Example 3: Using `join()`**
```java
CompletableFuture<String> workerFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    System.out.println("Worker thread: Task started.");
    try {
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
    return "Worker Task Result via Join";
});

System.out.println("Main thread: Initiated worker task with join.");

// join() does not require a checked exception handler.
String result = workerFuture.join(); // This is also a blocking call.
System.out.println("Main thread: Received result from worker via join -> " + result);
```
**Explanation**: This example is functionally similar to `get()`, but `join()`'s unchecked exception handling can simplify code where exceptions are not expected to be handled immediately.

**4. Retrieving Result Immediately (Non-Blocking if Not Complete): `getNow()`**
`getNow()` is used to get the result immediately if the `CompletableFuture` is already completed. If it's not complete, it returns a **default value** provided by the user, without throwing an exception.

**Conceptual Coding Example 4: `getNow()`**
```java
CompletableFuture<String> fastFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    // This task might take some time, e.g., 200ms
    try { Thread.sleep(200); } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
    return "Fast Task Done";
});

System.out.println("Main thread: Calling getNow() immediately.");

// This will likely print "Not Yet Complete" because 200ms is too fast for immediate completion.
String resultNow = fastFuture.getNow("Not Yet Complete"); //
System.out.println("Main thread: getNow() result: " + resultNow);

// Now, wait for actual completion to ensure the task finishes (otherwise JVM might exit if daemon)
try {
    System.out.println("Main thread: Waiting for actual fast future completion...");
    System.out.println("Main thread: Actual result: " + fastFuture.get());
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
**Explanation**: If `getNow()` is called before the `fastFuture` completes, it returns the provided default "Not Yet Complete" string. No exception is thrown.

**5. Combining Multiple `CompletableFutures`: `allOf()`**
`CompletableFuture.allOf()` is used when you need to wait for **multiple `CompletableFuture` instances to all complete** before proceeding.
*   It takes an array of `CompletableFuture` objects.
*   It returns a **new `CompletableFuture<Void>`**, which completes when all the input futures have completed.
*   If any of the individual `CompletableFuture`s complete exceptionally, the `allOf()`'s resulting `CompletableFuture` will also complete exceptionally.
*   Since it returns `CompletableFuture<Void>`, it **does not hold the results of the individual tasks directly**. To get individual results, you would still need to call `get()` or `join()` on each original `CompletableFuture` after `allOf()` completes.

**Conceptual Coding Example 5: `allOf()`**
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try { Thread.sleep(3000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
    return "Result A";
});

CompletableFuture<String> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
    return "Result B";
});

System.out.println("Main thread: Kicking off multiple futures...");

// Combine them using allOf. This CompletableFuture completes when both future1 and future2 are done.
CompletableFuture<Void> allFutures = CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2); //

try {
    // Wait for all futures to complete.
    allFutures.join(); // or .get()
    System.out.println("Main thread: All futures completed.");

    // To get individual results, you must call get() on each original future.
    String result1 = future1.get();
    String result2 = future2.get();
    System.out.println("Main thread: Individual results -> " + result1 + ", " + result2); //

} catch (Exception e) { // Catching generic Exception for join() which can throw CompletionException, or ExecutionException for get()
    System.err.println("Main thread: An error occurred with one of the futures: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
**Explanation**: The `allFutures.join()` call will block until both `future1` (3 seconds) and `future2` (2 seconds) have completed. This ensures that when the "All futures completed" message prints, both tasks are truly done.

**6. Chaining Operations: `thenApply()`**
`thenApply()` allows you to **process the result of a `CompletableFuture`** once it completes. It takes a `Lambda Expression` (a `Function` from Java 8) that receives the result of the previous `CompletableFuture` as input.

**Conceptual Coding Example 6: `thenApply()`**
```java
CompletableFuture<String> originalFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
    return "OK"; // Initial result
});

// Use thenApply to transform the result once originalFuture completes.
CompletableFuture<String> transformedFuture = originalFuture.thenApply(result -> { //
    System.out.println("thenApply: Processing result: " + result);
    return result + result; // e.g., "OK" becomes "OKOK"
});

System.out.println("Main thread: Original future initiated, thenApply chained.");

try {
    String finalResult = transformedFuture.get(); // Get the transformed result.
    System.out.println("Main thread: Final transformed result: " + finalResult); // Will be "OKOK".
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
**Explanation**: After `originalFuture` completes and returns "OK", `thenApply` is automatically invoked, taking "OK" as input and returning "OKOK". The `transformedFuture.get()` then retrieves this final, processed result.

**7. Error Handling with Timeouts: `orTimeout()` and `exceptionally()`**
`CompletableFuture` provides mechanisms for dealing with timeouts and exceptions gracefully.
*   **`orTimeout(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`**: This method allows you to set a timeout for the `CompletableFuture`. If the task doesn't complete within the specified duration, the `CompletableFuture` will complete exceptionally with a `TimeoutException`.
*   **`exceptionally(Function<Throwable, T> fn)`**: This method provides a way to recover from an exception. If the `CompletableFuture` completes exceptionally, the provided lambda expression (a `Function`) is executed, receiving the `Throwable` as input and returning a default or computed value to handle the error.

**Conceptual Coding Example 7: `orTimeout()` and `exceptionally()`**
```java
CompletableFuture<String> timedFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    System.out.println("Timed future: Starting a 5-second task...");
    try {
        Thread.sleep(5000); // This task takes 5 seconds
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
    return "Task Completed Successfully";
})
// Set a timeout of 1 second.
.orTimeout(1, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.SECONDS) //
// Handle the exception if a timeout or other error occurs.
.exceptionally(ex -> {
    if (ex instanceof java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException) {
        System.out.println("exceptionally: Timeout occurred!"); //
        return "Time Out Occurred"; // Provide a default value on timeout.
    } else {
        System.out.println("exceptionally: An unexpected error occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
        return "Error Result";
    }
});

System.out.println("Main thread: Initiated timed future with timeout and exception handling.");

try {
    String result = timedFuture.get(); // This will block and then get the result or the exceptional value.
    System.out.println("Main thread: Final result (after handling timeout): " + result); //
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    System.err.println("Main thread: get() caught an unexpected exception: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
**Explanation**: Since the task takes 5 seconds but the timeout is set to 1 second, the `orTimeout()` will trigger a `TimeoutException`. This exception is then caught by `exceptionally()`, which prints "Timeout occurred!" and returns "Time Out Occurred" as the result for `timedFuture`.

**8. Custom Thread Pool Management**
By default, `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` uses the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` [Information not directly in sources but implied by general Java knowledge]. However, you can provide a **custom `Executor`** (like a `FixedThreadPool`) to `supplyAsync()` to manage the threads more explicitly. This gives you **more control over thread management**, especially when you have many tasks and need to limit or control the number of threads used.

**Conceptual Coding Example 8: Using a Custom Executor**
```java
// 1. Create a custom Thread Pool (Executor).
java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService customThreadPool =
    java.util.concurrent.Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); // Example: 2 threads.

// 2. Pass the Executor to supplyAsync().
CompletableFuture<String> futureWithCustomPool = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    System.out.println("Worker in custom pool: Task running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    try {
        Thread.sleep(3000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
    return "Custom Pool Task Done";
}, customThreadPool); // Pass the custom executor here.

System.out.println("Main thread: Task submitted to custom thread pool.");

try {
    String result = futureWithCustomPool.get();
    System.out.println("Main thread: Result from custom pool task: " + result);
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    customThreadPool.shutdown(); // Important to shut down the custom pool [Not explicitly in sources, but good practice].
}
```
**Explanation**: Instead of using the default pool, `futureWithCustomPool`'s task will be executed by one of the threads managed by `customThreadPool`. This is useful for managing resource consumption when you have many asynchronous tasks.

**9. Further Exploration**
`CompletableFuture` is a **very flexible and interesting API**, but it's a **large topic introduced in Java 8**. It's recommended to explore its various methods (`thenAccept`, `thenCompose`, `handle`, etc.) once you have a good understanding of Java 8's functional programming concepts (like Lambdas and `Function` interfaces). The speaker encourages self-exploration by using IDE features like auto-completion to discover methods.
