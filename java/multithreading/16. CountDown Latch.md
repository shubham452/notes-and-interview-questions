### Notes on `CountDownLatch`

1.  **The Problem with `Future.get()` and `ExecutorService.invokeAll()`**
    *   When you have multiple tasks submitted to an `ExecutorService`, you often need to wait for all of them to complete before proceeding with the main thread's work.
    *   Using `Future.get()` repeatedly for each task becomes **cumbersome and repetitive** if there are many tasks.
    *   While `ExecutorService.invokeAll()` can submit all tasks and return a list of `Future` objects, it might still require iterating and calling `get()` on each, or it might block until all are done, but the speaker suggests a simpler alternative for just waiting for dependencies.
    *   The core issue is that the **main thread needs to wait for certain dependent services/tasks to finish** before it can continue its own operations.
    *   Manual thread creation with `Thread.join()` is also an option, but `CountDownLatch` offers a more elegant and simplified approach for this specific waiting scenario.

2.  **Introducing `CountDownLatch`**
    *   `CountDownLatch` is used when **one or more threads need to wait for the completion of a set of operations** being performed by other threads.
    *   It is favored for its **simplicity**.
    *   **Mechanism**:
        *   You create a `CountDownLatch` object by passing an **initial count** to its constructor. This count represents the number of operations or threads that the main thread needs to wait for.
        *   Each time a dependent task finishes its work, it calls `latch.countDown()`. This decrements the internal counter of the `CountDownLatch`.
        *   The main thread calls `latch.await()`. This method **blocks the main thread** until the internal counter of the `CountDownLatch` reaches zero.
        *   Once the count becomes zero, the "lock" or "latch" is opened, and the main thread resumes execution.
    *   The `latch.await()` method can also accept a **timeout** to limit how long the main thread will wait.

3.  **Scenarios for Using `CountDownLatch`**
    *   **Initialization Tasks**: It's useful when you have several initialization tasks (e.g., loading services, setting up resources) that must complete before the main application logic can start.
    *   **Waiting for Parallel Operations**: Any scenario where a main process needs to wait for multiple parallel threads/tasks to finish their execution before proceeding.

### Coding Examples

Here are the key coding examples discussed in the video:

#### Example 1: Using `CountDownLatch` with `ExecutorService` (Callable Tasks)

This example demonstrates how to use `CountDownLatch` to wait for three "dependent services" to complete their work before the main thread proceeds.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*; // For ExecutorService, Callable, Future
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch; // For CountDownLatch

// 1. Define the DependentService class (Worker Thread)
class DependentService implements Callable<String> {
    private final CountDownLatch latch; // The latch object is passed to each service

    // Constructor to receive the CountDownLatch
    public DependentService(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Override
    public String call() throws Exception {
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started...");
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work for 2 seconds
            return Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished!";
        } finally {
            // It's good practice to put countDown() in a finally block
            // to ensure it's called even if an exception occurs
            latch.countDown(); // Decrement the latch counter
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " counted down. Latch count: " + latch.getCount());
        }
    }
}

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        // Number of dependent services we need to wait for
        int numberOfServices = 3; 

        // 2. Create an ExecutorService
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfServices);

        // 3. Create a CountDownLatch with the number of services
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

        // 4. Submit tasks to the ExecutorService
        System.out.println("Submitting dependent services...");
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfServices; i++) {
            executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch)); // Pass the latch to each service
        }

        // 5. Main thread waits for the latch to count down to zero
        System.out.println("Main method is waiting for all dependent services to finish...");
        latch.await(); // This will block until all 3 services call countDown()

        // 6. Once the latch is open, the main thread resumes
        System.out.println("All dependent services finished. Starting Main Service work.");
        System.out.println("Main method proceeding...");

        // 7. Shut down the ExecutorService
        executorService.shutdown();
        // Optional: Wait for all tasks to terminate gracefully
        if (!executorService.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            executorService.shutdownNow();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: Using `CountDownLatch` with Manual Thread Creation (Runnable Tasks)

This demonstrates that `CountDownLatch` can be used independently of `ExecutorService` by manually creating and starting threads. The worker class now implements `Runnable` and overrides `run()`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; // For await with timeout

// 1. Define the DependentService class (Worker Thread - Runnable)
class ManualDependentService implements Runnable {
    private final CountDownLatch latch;

    public ManualDependentService(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started...");
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work for 2 seconds
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished!");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupt status
            System.err.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " was interrupted.");
        } finally {
            latch.countDown(); // Decrement the latch counter
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " counted down. Latch count: " + latch.getCount());
        }
    }
}

public class ManualCountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int numberOfServices = 3;

        // 2. Create a CountDownLatch
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

        // 3. Create and start threads manually
        System.out.println("Starting manual dependent services...");
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfServices; i++) {
            new Thread(new ManualDependentService(latch), "Thread-" + (i + 1)).start(); // Create and start thread
        }

        // 4. Main thread waits
        System.out.println("Main method is waiting for all manual dependent services to finish...");
        latch.await(); // Main thread blocks until latch count is zero

        System.out.println("All manual dependent services finished. Main method proceeding...");
    }
}
```

#### Example 3: `await()` with Timeout and `shutdownNow()`

This example illustrates the behavior of `latch.await()` with a timeout and the effect of `ExecutorService.shutdownNow()` when tasks are still running.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

// Reusing DependentService from Example 1 (Callable)
// If you use ManualDependentService (Runnable), modify main accordingly.
// For this example, let's assume DependentService (Callable) as in the video's context.

class DependentServiceWithLongWork implements Callable<String> {
    private final CountDownLatch latch;
    private final int workDuration; // Duration in milliseconds

    public DependentServiceWithLongWork(CountDownLatch latch, int workDuration) {
        this.latch = latch;
        this.workDuration = workDuration;
    }

    @Override
    public String call() throws Exception {
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started, working for " + workDuration + "ms.");
            Thread.sleep(workDuration); // Simulate long work
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished work.");
            return Thread.currentThread().getName() + " done.";
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " interrupted during work.");
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return Thread.currentThread().getName() + " interrupted.";
        } finally {
            // Count down even if interrupted or after completing work
            latch.countDown();
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " counted down. Latch count: " + latch.getCount());
        }
    }
}

public class CountDownLatchTimeoutExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int numberOfServices = 3;
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfServices);
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

        // Case A: Await with timeout shorter than work duration
        System.out.println("--- Case A: Await with timeout (5s) shorter than actual work (6s) ---");
        System.out.println("Submitting tasks, each taking 6 seconds...");
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfServices; i++) {
            executorService.submit(new DependentServiceWithLongWork(latch, 6000)); // Each task takes 6 seconds
        }

        long awaitTimeout = 5; // seconds
        System.out.println("Main method waiting for " + awaitTimeout + " seconds...");
        boolean allTasksCompleted = latch.await(awaitTimeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // Wait with a timeout

        if (allTasksCompleted) {
            System.out.println("Main: All tasks completed within the timeout.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Main: Timeout reached (" + awaitTimeout + "s). Tasks are still running in the background.");
            // At this point, the main thread continues, but worker threads are still active
            System.out.println("Main method proceeding after timeout.");
        }

        // It's important to reset the latch and executor for a new scenario
        // In a real application, you wouldn't typically reuse them like this.
        // For demonstration, we'll shut down and create new ones.
        executorService.shutdown();
        if (!executorService.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) { // Give a short time for graceful shutdown
            executorService.shutdownNow(); // Force shutdown if tasks are still running
        }
        System.out.println("ExecutorService (Case A) shut down.");

        // Case B: Await with timeout and then shutdownNow
        System.out.println("\n--- Case B: Await with timeout (5s) then shutdownNow ---");
        ExecutorService executorService2 = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfServices);
        CountDownLatch latch2 = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

        System.out.println("Submitting tasks, each taking 6 seconds...");
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfServices; i++) {
            executorService2.submit(new DependentServiceWithLongWork(latch2, 6000)); // Each task takes 6 seconds
        }

        long awaitTimeout2 = 5; // seconds
        System.out.println("Main method waiting for " + awaitTimeout2 + " seconds...");
        boolean allTasksCompleted2 = latch2.await(awaitTimeout2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        if (allTasksCompleted2) {
            System.out.println("Main: All tasks completed within the timeout.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Main: Timeout reached (" + awaitTimeout2 + "s). Forcibly stopping worker threads.");
            executorService2.shutdownNow(); // Immediately stops worker threads
            // You will see 'interrupted during work' messages from worker threads
            // and no 'finished work' or 'counted down' messages from stopped threads
            System.out.println("Main method proceeding after shutdownNow.");
        }
        
        executorService2.shutdown(); // Redundant after shutdownNow, but good practice for completeness.
        // No need for awaitTermination after shutdownNow if immediate stop is desired.
    }
}
```
