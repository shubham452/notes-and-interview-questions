Here are notes on synchronization, drawing from the provided sources and illustrated with examples:

*   **The Problem: Inconsistent Results with Shared Resources**
    *   When multiple threads access and modify a **common, shared object**, the final result can be **inconsistent and unpredictable**.
    *   **Example Setup**:
        *   A `Counter` class has a `private int count = 0;` field and an `increment()` method that performs `count++`.
        *   A `MyThread` class extends `Thread` and holds a reference to a `Counter` object, passed through its constructor.
        *   The `run()` method of `MyThread` calls `counter.increment()` 1000 times within a loop.
        *   When two `MyThread` objects (`t1`, `t2`) are created and both share the *same `Counter` object*, they are both trying to increment the *same `count` variable*.
    *   **The Inconsistency**:
        *   Ideally, if each of the two threads increments the `count` 1000 times, the final `count` should be 2000.
        *   However, without synchronization, the output is often less than 2000 (e.g., 1846, 1764), and it varies each time the program is run.
        *   This happens because both threads can simultaneously read the same `count` value, increment it, and then write it back. If Thread A reads `count` as 101, and Thread B also reads `count` as 101 almost simultaneously, both will increment it to 102 and write it back, effectively losing one increment. The outcome depends on the relative timing of the threads.

*   **The Solution: The `synchronized` Keyword**
    *   The `synchronized` keyword ensures that **only one thread can execute a specific piece of code (a method or a block) at a time** on a given object. Other threads trying to access that synchronized code on the same object will wait until the first thread finishes.
    *   **Synchronizing a Method**:
        *   You can apply `synchronized` directly to a method declaration.
        *   **Example**: Making the `increment()` method of the `Counter` class `synchronized`:
            ```java
            // In Counter.java
            public synchronized void increment() {
                count++;
            }
            ```
        *   After adding `synchronized` to `increment()`, running the two threads will consistently produce the correct result of 2000, because only one thread can execute `increment()` at any given moment.
    *   **Synchronizing a Block**:
        *   If you only need to protect a *specific part* of a method, rather than the entire method, you can use a `synchronized` block.
        *   You specify an object (often `this` for the current instance) on which the lock is acquired.
        *   **Example**: Synchronizing only the `count++` operation:
            ```java
            // In Counter.java
            public void increment() {
                // ... other code ...
                synchronized (this) { // 'this' refers to the current Counter instance
                    count++;
                }
                // ... other code ...
            }
            ```
        *   The `synchronized (this)` block ensures that for a particular `Counter` instance, only one thread can execute the `count++` line at a time. If you have multiple `Counter` objects, their operations will be independent.

*   **Key Terminology**
    *   **Critical Section**:
        *   This refers to the **part of your program where shared resources are accessed or modified**. This is the code that needs protection from simultaneous access by multiple threads.
        *   **Example**: In the `Counter` class, the `increment()` method (specifically the `count++` operation) is the critical section because it accesses and modifies the shared `count` variable.
    *   **Race Condition**:
        *   A race condition occurs when **multiple threads are working on a shared resource**, and the **outcome depends on their relative timing**, leading to unpredictable or incorrect results. This is the problem `synchronized` aims to solve.
        *   **Example**: The inconsistent outputs (e.g., 1846 instead of 2000) observed when `increment()` was not synchronized illustrate a race condition. The final `count` value was "racing" between the threads, leading to lost updates.
    *   **Mutual Exclusion**:
        *   This is the **condition achieved by `synchronized`**, where **only one thread can access the critical section at a time**, thereby preventing multiple threads from simultaneously modifying shared resources.
        *   It ensures that threads "mutually exclude" each other from concurrently executing the critical section.
        *   By using `synchronized`, you achieve mutual exclusion, which in turn prevents race conditions and ensures correct, predictable results.
