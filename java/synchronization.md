Here are notes on synchronization, drawing from the provided sources and illustrated with examples:

*   **The Problem: Inconsistent Results with Shared Resources**
    *   When multiple threads access and modify a **common, shared object**, the final result can be **inconsistent and unpredictable**.
    *   **Example Setup**:
        *   A `Counter` class has a `private int count = 0;` field and an `increment()` method that performs `count++`.
        *   A `MyThread` class extends `Thread` and holds a reference to a `Counter` object, passed through its constructor.
        *   The `run()` method of `MyThread` calls `counter.increment()` 1000 times within a loop.
        *   When two `MyThread` objects (`t1`, `t2`) are created and both share the *same `Counter` object*, they are both trying to increment the *same `count` variable*.
    *   **The Inconsistency**:
        *   Ideally, if each of the two threads increments the `count` 1000 times, the final `count` should be 2000.
        *   However, without synchronization, the output is often less than 2000 (e.g., 1846, 1764), and it varies each time the program is run.
        *   This happens because both threads can simultaneously read the same `count` value, increment it, and then write it back. If Thread A reads `count` as 101, and Thread B also reads `count` as 101 almost simultaneously, both will increment it to 102 and write it back, effectively losing one increment. The outcome depends on the relative timing of the threads.

*   **The Solution: The `synchronized` Keyword**
    *   The `synchronized` keyword ensures that **only one thread can execute a specific piece of code (a method or a block) at a time** on a given object. Other threads trying to access that synchronized code on the same object will wait until the first thread finishes.
    *   **Synchronizing a Method**:
        *   You can apply `synchronized` directly to a method declaration.
        *   **Example**: Making the `increment()` method of the `Counter` class `synchronized`:
            ```java
            // In Counter.java
            public synchronized void increment() {
                count++;
            }
            ```
        *   After adding `synchronized` to `increment()`, running the two threads will consistently produce the correct result of 2000, because only one thread can execute `increment()` at any given moment.
    *   **Synchronizing a Block**:
        *   If you only need to protect a *specific part* of a method, rather than the entire method, you can use a `synchronized` block.
        *   You specify an object (often `this` for the current instance) on which the lock is acquired.
        *   **Example**: Synchronizing only the `count++` operation:
            ```java
            // In Counter.java
            public void increment() {
                // ... other code ...
                synchronized (this) { // 'this' refers to the current Counter instance
                    count++;
                }
                // ... other code ...
            }
            ```
        *   The `synchronized (this)` block ensures that for a particular `Counter` instance, only one thread can execute the `count++` line at a time. If you have multiple `Counter` objects, their operations will be independent.

Based on the sources, here are the code examples illustrating the concept of synchronization, including both the problematic unsynchronized version and the synchronized solutions.

### 1. `Counter` Class (Initial - Unsynchronized)

This class holds the shared resource (`count`) that multiple threads will try to modify concurrently.

```java
// Counter.java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0; // The shared resource

    public void increment() { // This method accesses and modifies the shared 'count'
        count++; // This is the critical section
    }

    public int getCount() { // Method to retrieve the current count
        return count;
    }
}
```

### 2. `MyThread` Class

This class defines a thread that will repeatedly call the `increment()` method on a `Counter` object. Multiple instances of `MyThread` will share a single `Counter` object to demonstrate the synchronization problem.

```java
// MyThread.java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    private Counter counter; // Field to hold the shared Counter object

    // Constructor to receive and set the shared Counter object
    public MyThread(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Loop to call increment() 1000 times
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            counter.increment(); // Calling the increment method on the shared Counter
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. `Test` Class (Demonstrating the Race Condition - Unsynchronized)

This `Test` class creates a single `Counter` object and two `MyThread` objects, both sharing the *same* `Counter`. It then starts both threads and waits for them to complete before printing the final count.

```java
// Test.java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Create a single Counter object
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        // Create two MyThread objects, both sharing the SAME Counter object
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(counter);
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(counter);

        // Start both threads
        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Wait for both threads to finish execution
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        // Print the final count
        System.out.println("Finally Counter's count: " + counter.getCount());
        // Expected: 2000 (1000 from t1 + 1000 from t2)
        // Actual (without synchronization): Often less than 2000 (e.g., 1846, 1764), and varies
        // This unpredictable outcome due to concurrent access is a Race Condition
    }
}
```

### 4. `Counter` Class (Synchronized Method Solution)

To fix the race condition and ensure consistent results, the `increment()` method in the `Counter` class is made `synchronized`. This ensures that **only one thread can execute this method on a given `Counter` object at any time**, achieving **mutual exclusion**.

```java
// Counter.java (with synchronized method)
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // The 'synchronized' keyword ensures mutual exclusion for this method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++; // Only one thread can execute this critical section at a time
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```
When running the `Test` class with this `Counter` class, the output for "Finally Counter's count:" will consistently be **2000**.

### 5. `Counter` Class (Synchronized Block Solution)

If only a specific part of a method needs to be protected, you can use a `synchronized` block. The `synchronized (this)` syntax locks on the current instance of the `Counter` object, ensuring that only one thread can execute the code within that block at a time for that specific instance.

Yes, in the video, after demonstrating the `synchronized (this)` block, it is suggested to make the entire method `public synchronized void increment()` for a cleaner approach.

Here is the `Counter` class with the `increment()` method made `synchronized`, as shown in the video:

### `Counter` Class (with Synchronized Method)

This approach uses the `synchronized` keyword directly on the `increment()` method. This ensures that **only one thread can execute this `increment` method on a given `Counter` object at any time**, providing **mutual exclusion** for the critical section.

```java
// Counter.java (with synchronized method)
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0; // The shared resource

    // The 'synchronized' keyword on the method ensures mutual exclusion
    // for the entire method execution for a given object instance.
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++; // This is the critical section
    }

    public int getCount() { // Method to retrieve the current count
        return count;
    }
}
```

When this `Counter` class is used with the `MyThread` and `Test` classes previously discussed, the output for "Finally Counter's count:" will **consistently be 2000**. This is because the `synchronized` keyword prevents the **race condition** by ensuring that concurrent threads do not access and modify the shared `count` variable simultaneously in an unpredictable manner.

The video explains that both making a **method synchronized** or using a **synchronized block** achieve the goal of **mutual exclusion**, which means that multiple threads cannot simultaneously access the **critical section** (the part of the code where shared resources are accessed or modified).
```
This version also ensures that the "Finally Counter's count:" consistently outputs **2000** when run with the `Test` class.
*   **Key Terminology**
    *   **Critical Section**:
        *   This refers to the **part of your program where shared resources are accessed or modified**. This is the code that needs protection from simultaneous access by multiple threads.
        *   **Example**: In the `Counter` class, the `increment()` method (specifically the `count++` operation) is the critical section because it accesses and modifies the shared `count` variable.
    *   **Race Condition**:
        *   A race condition occurs when **multiple threads are working on a shared resource**, and the **outcome depends on their relative timing**, leading to unpredictable or incorrect results. This is the problem `synchronized` aims to solve.
        *   **Example**: The inconsistent outputs (e.g., 1846 instead of 2000) observed when `increment()` was not synchronized illustrate a race condition. The final `count` value was "racing" between the threads, leading to lost updates.
    *   **Mutual Exclusion**:
        *   This is the **condition achieved by `synchronized`**, where **only one thread can access the critical section at a time**, thereby preventing multiple threads from simultaneously modifying shared resources.
        *   It ensures that threads "mutually exclude" each other from concurrently executing the critical section.
        *   By using `synchronized`, you achieve mutual exclusion, which in turn prevents race conditions and ensures correct, predictable results.
