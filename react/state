🧠 React State – Master Notes
Covers: useState, updates, batching, stale closures, performance optimization, and more.

✅ 1. What is React State?
State in React is a plain JavaScript object used to represent information about the component’s current situation. When state changes, React re-renders the component.

In functional components, state is managed using the useState hook.


const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
✅ 2. How useState Works
useState(initialValue) returns an array:
[currentState, setStateFunction]

⚡ Common Patterns:

const [name, setName] = useState('Shubham');
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: '', age: 0 });
✅ 3. Updating State
State is never updated directly.

🚫 count = count + 1;
✅ setCount(count + 1);

✅ 4. Functional Updates
Use functional updates when new state depends on previous value.


setCount(prev => prev + 1);
🔁 Especially useful inside loops, async callbacks, or debouncing.

✅ 5. Lazy Initialization
Useful when the initial state requires expensive computation.


const [data, setData] = useState(() => computeHeavy());
✔️ The function runs only on the first render.

✅ 6. State and Re-rendering
React re-renders the component when:

The state or props change

But only if the new value is different (shallow check)

🔁 Same value? → No re-render.


setCount(5); // If already 5 → No render
✅ 7. State Batching (React 18+)
React batches multiple state updates into a single re-render.


setCount(1);
setName('John');
// Only one render will happen.
🧠 Even works inside setTimeout, promises, and async/await in React 18+.

✅ 8. Immutability in State
React compares object references (not deep equality).

So, always update non-primitive (object/array) state immutably.


setUser(prev => ({ ...prev, name: 'Shubham' }));
🔴 Direct mutation (e.g. user.name = "New") → React won’t detect.

✅ 9. Avoiding Stale State (Closure Issue)
In async callbacks or handlers, you might read stale values.

🔁 Solution: Use functional updates.


setCount(prev => prev + 1);
✅ 10. Rules of Hooks – No Conditional useState
Hooks must be called in the same order on every render.

🚫 Don’t do:


if (condition) {
  useState(...); // ❌
}
✅ Instead:


const [value, setValue] = useState(condition ? 'Yes' : 'No');
✅ 11. Resetting State
Reset by calling the setter with the initial value.

setCount(0);
Each useState is independent, so reset individually.

✅ 12. Sharing State Between Components
Local State → stays within a component

To share state:

Lift it up to a common ancestor

Use Context API

Use Redux or other global state libs

✅ 13. Derived vs Independent State
Derived State = Calculated from props/state
Independent State = Manages its own value

🛑 Avoid storing derived state in useState

✅ Instead compute during render:


const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
✅ 14. useEffect and State
Common issues:
Infinite loops when setting state inside useEffect without proper dependencies

Cleanup is needed to avoid memory leaks with timers


useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setValue(input);
  }, 300);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [input]);
✅ 15. Tracking Previous State
Use useRef to store previous values.


const prevCount = useRef();
useEffect(() => {
  prevCount.current = count;
}, [count]);
🟡 useRef does not cause re-renders.

✅ 16. Force a Re-render
React only re-renders if state changes.

To force a re-render:


const [, forceUpdate] = useState(0);
forceUpdate(n => n + 1);
✅ 17. Throttle or Debounce State Updates
Throttle: regulate state update frequency
Debounce: wait until user stops typing


useEffect(() => {
  const id = setTimeout(() => {
    setQuery(input);
  }, 300);
  return () => clearTimeout(id);
}, [input]);
✅ 18. React 18: startTransition()
Mark non-urgent state updates to avoid UI jank.


startTransition(() => {
  setSearchResults(data);
});
✅ 19. Common Anti-patterns to Avoid
❌ Bad Pattern	✅ Correct Approach
Copying props to state unnecessarily	Derive values in render or useEffect
Mutating state directly	Use immutable updates (spread, immer)
Using useState inside conditionals	Call useState at top level always
setState in render	Move to useEffect or handlers

🧠 Extra: React Re-render Triggers Summary
Trigger	Causes Re-render?
setState with new value	✅
setState with same value	❌
Direct mutation of object	❌
Functional update	✅
Ref value change	❌
