# ✅ React.StrictMode – Master Notes

> Covers: Lifecycle checks, side-effects, concurrent prep, effect cleanup testing, and best practices.

---

## 🔰 1. What is React.StrictMode?

`<React.StrictMode>` is a **development-only helper** that helps identify potential problems in your React components.

```jsx
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>
````

* 🔍 Detects unsafe lifecycle methods
* ⚠️ Warns about deprecated APIs
* 🔁 Double-invokes `useEffect`, `componentDidMount`, etc.
* 🧼 Checks for memory leaks and cleanup issues
* ✅ Does not affect production builds or render any UI

---

## 🛠️ 2. Why Use StrictMode?

* Surfaces unexpected side-effects
* Prepares your app for **Concurrent Rendering**
* Helps migrate legacy or unsafe code
* 🚫 Doesn’t block rendering — logs warnings to the console

---

## 🧪 3. How StrictMode Works

🔁 Re-invokes rendering logic:

* Triggers lifecycle/effect methods twice to test cleanup
* Detects **impure rendering** or **leaking effects**

❌ Flags the following **unsafe legacy methods**:

* `componentWillMount`
* `componentWillReceiveProps`
* `componentWillUpdate`

✅ Use modern alternatives:

* `componentDidMount`
* `getDerivedStateFromProps`
* `useEffect`

---

## ⚙️ 4. Behavior with useEffect

StrictMode double-invokes to simulate mounting/unmounting.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Effect ran');
  return () => console.log('Cleanup');
}, []);
```

Expected Console Output:

```
Effect ran
Cleanup
Effect ran
```

✅ Only in development
❌ Not repeated in production

---

## 🧼 5. Detecting Side Effects

StrictMode helps identify:

* Async effects that don’t clean up properly
* DOM mutations outside `useEffect`
* Using `useLayoutEffect` when `useEffect` suffices

---

## 🧱 6. Testing Cleanup and Mounting Logic

StrictMode simulates:

```
Mount → Unmount → Mount (again)
```

✅ Helps test:

* Resource teardown (e.g., clearInterval, event listeners)
* Memory leak prevention

Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(...);
  return () => clearInterval(id); // cleanup
}, []);
```

---

## ⚙️ 7. Concurrent Rendering Preparation

StrictMode prepares components for **Concurrent Mode** by:

* Emulating re-entrancy
* Warning for impure rendering or DOM mutations

✅ Makes components future-proof
❌ Does not enable full concurrency itself

---

## 🧠 8. Effect on React.memo and Memoization

* `React.memo` components may re-render unexpectedly in StrictMode
* Helps **detect impure memoized components**

✅ Keep using `memo`
⚠️ Ensure **pure rendering functions**

---

## ⚡ 9. useLayoutEffect vs useEffect Warnings

StrictMode warns if:

* `useLayoutEffect` **blocks painting**

✅ Use `useLayoutEffect` only for:

* Synchronous DOM measurements

❌ Avoid it for:

* Side effects like API calls or data fetches

---

## 🧩 10. Can You Nest or Scope StrictMode?

✅ Yes, you can apply `StrictMode` to specific parts of your app.

```jsx
<StrictMode>
  <Header />
</StrictMode>
<Main /> // Not in StrictMode
```

💡 Great for **gradual adoption** in legacy codebases.

---

## 🛡️ 11. Is StrictMode Used in Production?

❌ No.
It is **stripped out during production builds** (`react-dom.production.min.js`).

🛠 Only useful during development/debugging.

---

## 🔄 12. How to Add StrictMode in Legacy Codebases

Steps:

1. Wrap new components in `<StrictMode>`
2. Fix console warnings
3. Expand coverage to more components
4. Replace or patch incompatible third-party libraries

---

## 🧱 13. StrictMode Limitations

| Limitation          | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🛠 Dev Only         | No effect in production                       |
| ❌ Not a Bug Catcher | Doesn’t catch all runtime bugs                |
| 🧪 Lifecycle Focus  | Only detects lifecycle and side-effect issues |

---

## ⚠️ 14. StrictMode Common Warnings

* `Warning: Unsafe lifecycle methods`
* `Warning: useEffect cleanup not handled`
* `Warning: DOM mutations outside effect`
* `Warning: useLayoutEffect blocks paint`

---

## 🔍 15. StrictMode Summary Table

| Feature                           | Enabled in Dev? | Enabled in Prod? | Notes                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Warns on unsafe lifecycles        | ✅               | ❌                | Logs to console        |
| Double run of effects             | ✅               | ❌                | For testing cleanup    |
| Detects legacy patterns           | ✅               | ❌                | Helps migration        |
| Simulates unmount/remount         | ✅               | ❌                | Tests resource cleanup |
| Prepares for Concurrent Rendering | ✅               | ❌                | Future-proofing        |
