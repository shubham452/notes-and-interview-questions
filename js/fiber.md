⚛️ React Fiber – The Engine Behind React
🔍 What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is the reconciliation engine in React (from version 16+), which is responsible for rendering and updating the UI.

It’s a complete rewrite of React’s core algorithm to make rendering incremental, interruptible, and smarter.

💡 Real Example: Time Slicing
Imagine you’re rendering a list of 10,000 items.

Without Fiber: browser freezes

With Fiber: rendering pauses every few ms to stay responsive to input (like scroll or click)

🧠 Why Was Fiber Introduced?
Before Fiber, React used a recursive, synchronous render. It couldn’t pause work — bad for performance in complex apps.

Old vs. New:
Feature	Stack Reconciler (old)	Fiber (new)
Interruptible rendering	❌ No	✅ Yes
Prioritized updates	❌ No	✅ Yes
Time slicing	❌ No	✅ Yes
Better animations	❌ Poor	✅ Smoother
Error boundaries	❌ No	✅ Yes

🏗️ How Fiber Works – Simple View
Think of your component tree as a linked list of units of work:

Each component = a Fiber Node

Fiber nodes are linked like:

parent, child, sibling, return

React can pause, resume, discard, or reuse work on these nodes.

🔄 Reconciliation with Fiber
Fiber enables incremental rendering:

Begin phase – build the fiber tree (work-in-progress)

Complete phase – commit updates

React can now interrupt rendering (e.g., pause a large list render to handle a click).

🚀 Features Enabled by Fiber
🧩 Concurrent Mode

⏳ Time slicing

🧵 Suspense and lazy loading

📉 Better memory and performance

🔥 Error boundaries

🔁 Back-to-back renders without flicker



🔬 Internal Structure (Simplified Fiber Node)
js
Copy
Edit
{
  type: MyComponent,
  child: FiberNode,
  sibling: FiberNode,
  return: ParentFiber,
  stateNode: DOM node or class instance,
  alternate: previous Fiber (for diffing),
  effectTag: "PLACEMENT" | "UPDATE" | "DELETION"
}
⚠️ Should You Use Fiber Directly?
No. It’s internal. But knowing about Fiber helps you:

Write better performant components

Understand why Suspense/Concurrent Mode work

Avoid anti-patterns like blocking renders

🧪 Summary
Concept	Description
Fiber	New rendering engine from React 16+
Key Feature	Interruptible, async rendering
Enables	Concurrent UI, Suspense, smooth animations
Real Benefit	Faster, responsive apps with large UIs
You Use It?	Indirectly — via APIs like useTransition
