### **Notes on Closures in JavaScript**

1.  **Definition of a Closure**
   A **closure** is a function that **remembers the variables from its
outer scope** even after the outer function has finished executing.
    *   In simple terms, a **closure** means that a **function along with its lexical environment forms a closure**.
    *   It is described as a **function bundled together with its surrounding state or lexical environment**.
    *   This implies that a function remembers its lexical scope even when it is executed outside that scope.

3.  **Lexical Environment / Lexical Scope**
    *   **Lexical scope** refers to **where a function or variable is physically present in the code**. It's the environment in which the code is written or defined.
    *   Every function and block has its own lexical scope, and these scopes can be nested.
    *   When a function is defined, it "remembers" its lexical environment (i.e., the variables and functions that were available in its scope at the time of its creation).

4.  **Core Concept: Remembering the Lexical Environment**
    *   The most significant aspect of closures is that **even after an outer function's execution context has finished and conceptually "disappeared," the inner function (the closure) still retains a reference to the variables in its parent's lexical scope**.
    *   This means that the inner function can **access and manipulate** these outer variables even when it's invoked much later and from a different part of the code.

5.  **How Closures Form and Behave**
    *   When an inner function is returned from an outer function, it doesn't just return the function's code; it returns the function **along with its entire lexical environment**.
    *   This "bundle" of function code and its preserved lexical scope is what constitutes the closure.
    *   The variables from the outer scope are not just passed by value; the closure holds a **reference** to these variables, meaning if their value changes, the closure will see the updated value.

6.  **Importance and Use Cases of Closures**
    *   Closures are a **fundamental concept in JavaScript** and are the basis for many powerful patterns.
    *   They enable functionalities like **currying** (transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument) and **higher-order functions**.
    *   They are crucial for **module design patterns** and for achieving **data privacy or encapsulation** (hiding private variables and functions from the global scope).
    *   Other applications include **debouncing** and **memoization**.
    *   Understanding closures is considered a **very common and important interview question**.

### **Coding Example: Basic Closure**

This example demonstrates how an inner function, even after being returned from its parent, maintains access to variables from its parent's lexical scope.

```javascript
// 1. Define an outer function 'x'
function x() {
  var a = 7; // 'a' is a variable in the lexical scope of function 'x'

  // 2. Define an inner function 'y'
  //    'y' is lexically inside 'x', so it has access to 'a'.
  function y() {
    console.log(a); // 'y' refers to 'a' from its lexical parent 'x'
  }

  // 3. Instead of calling 'y' immediately, 'x' returns 'y'.
  //    This is where the magic of closure happens.
  return y;
}

// 4. Call function 'x' and store its return value (which is function 'y')
//    into a variable named 'z'.
//    At this point, the execution context of 'x' is conceptually "long gone".
var z = x();

// 5. Now, call 'z'. Since 'z' holds function 'y', we are essentially calling 'y'.
//    Despite 'x' having finished execution, 'y' (via 'z') still remembers 'a'.
console.log("Calling the function 'z' (which is 'y') after 'x' has finished:");
z(); // Expected Output: 7
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

1.  **`function x()` is defined**: Inside `x`, a `var` variable `a` is declared with a value of `7`.
2.  **`function y()` is defined INSIDE `x()`**: Because `y` is defined inside `x`, its lexical environment includes `a`.
3.  **`x()` returns `y`**: Instead of executing `y` immediately, `x` returns the function `y` itself.
4.  **`var z = x()`**: When `x()` is called, it executes, `a` is initialized, and then `y` is returned. The returned `y` function is assigned to `z`. Crucially, at this point, the execution context of `x` is popped off the call stack and considered "gone". You might expect `a` to be garbage collected since `x` is done.
5.  **`z()` is called**: When `z()` is called (which is actually `y()`), it still needs to find the value of `a`. This is where the **closure** comes into play:
    *   The `y` function, when it was returned from `x`, **bundled itself together with its lexical environment**.
    *   This bundle (the closure) means that `y` still holds a **reference** to the variable `a` from `x`'s scope, even though `x` has completed its execution.
    *   Therefore, `y` successfully accesses `a` and prints `7` to the console.

This mechanism is why closures are so powerful, allowing functions to "remember" data from their creation environment, even when that environment no longer exists in the call stack.

**üöÄ Closures in JavaScript**

A **closure** is a function that **remembers the variables from its
outer scope** even after the outer function has finished executing.

Closures are powerful because they **allow functions to retain access to
variables from their lexical scope**, even when executed outside that
scope.

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Example of Closures**

function outerFunction() {

let outerVariable = \"I am from outer scope\";

function innerFunction() {

console.log(outerVariable); // ‚úÖ Accesses outerVariable even after
outerFunction is done

}

return innerFunction;

}

const closureFunction = outerFunction(); // outerFunction executes and
returns innerFunction

closureFunction(); // ‚úÖ \"I am from outer scope\"

**üîπ How It Works**

1.  outerFunction is executed, creating a new scope.

2.  Inside outerFunction, outerVariable is defined.

3.  innerFunction is defined inside outerFunction and **has access to
    outerVariable**.

4.  outerFunction **returns** innerFunction, which is stored in
    closureFunction.

5.  When we call closureFunction(), it **remembers the scope** in which
    it was created and logs \"I am from outer scope\".

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Closures Maintain State**

Closures **can store state** across function calls.

**üîπ Example: Counter Using Closures**

function createCounter() {

let count = 0; // Private variable

return function () {

count++;

console.log(\`Count: \${count}\`);

};

}

const counter1 = createCounter();

counter1(); // Count: 1

counter1(); // Count: 2

const counter2 = createCounter();

counter2(); // Count: 1 (separate instance)

counter2(); // Count: 2

üîπ **Why?**

- Each call to createCounter() creates a **new instance** of count, so
  counter1 and counter2 have separate counters.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Uses of Closures**

**‚úÖ Data Hiding & Encapsulation**

Closures allow you to **hide data** and prevent it from being modified
directly.

function secretHolder(secret) {

return {

getSecret: function () {

return secret;

}

};

}

const mySecret = secretHolder(\"I love JavaScript\");

console.log(mySecret.getSecret()); // \"I love JavaScript\"

console.log(mySecret.secret); // ‚ùå undefined (cannot access directly)

üí° **Why?**

- secret is not accessible directly but is **remembered** by the
  returned function.

**‚úÖ Function Factories**

Closures can be used to **create multiple functions with preset
behavior**.

function multiplyBy(factor) {

return function (number) {

return number \* factor;

};

}

const double = multiplyBy(2);

console.log(double(5)); // 10

const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(triple(5)); // 15

üí° **Why?**

- double and triple each **remember** their own factor.

**‚úÖ Event Listeners Using Closures**

Closures can help maintain **state in event handlers**.

function attachEventListener() {

let count = 0;

document.getElementById(\"myButton\").addEventListener(\"click\",
function () {

count++;

console.log(\`Button clicked \${count} times\`);

});

}

attachEventListener();

üí° **Why?**

- The event listener **remembers count** even after
  attachEventListener() has finished execution.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Closures and Loops**

Closures can sometimes cause **unexpected behavior in loops**.

**üîπ Example: Using var (Unexpected Output)**

for (var i = 1; i \<= 3; i++) {

setTimeout(function () {

console.log(i);

}, 1000);

}

‚õî **Output (after 1 second)**:

CopyEdit

4

4

4

üîπ **Why?**

- var is function-scoped, so **all closures share the same i (which is 4
  when setTimeout runs).**

**üîπ Fix Using let**

for (let i = 1; i \<= 3; i++) {

setTimeout(function () {

console.log(i);

}, 1000);

}

‚úÖ **Output**:

1

2

3

üí° **Why?**

- let creates a new **block-scoped** variable for each iteration.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Closures in setTimeout**

Closures are often used in setTimeout() functions.

**‚úÖ Delayed Execution**

function delayedMessage(message, delay) {

setTimeout(function () {

console.log(message);

}, delay);

}

delayedMessage(\"Hello after 2 seconds\", 2000);

üí° **Why?**

- The callback inside setTimeout **remembers** message even after
  delayedMessage() has executed.

**üöÄ Summary**

‚úÖ **Closures allow functions to \"remember\" variables from their outer
scope even after execution.**  
‚úÖ **They are used for:**

- Data hiding (private variables)

- Function factories (creating pre-configured functions)

- Maintaining state in event handlers & loops

- Delayed execution with setTimeout

# Currying Interview Questions: Comprehensive Guide

## What is Currying?

Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. It transforms a function from callable as `f(a, b, c)` into callable as `f(a)(b)(c)`.[1][2]

```javascript
// Normal function
function add(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

// Curried function
function curriedAdd(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return function(c) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }
}

// Usage
console.log(add(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(curriedAdd(1)(2)(3)); // 6
```

## Types of Currying Interview Questions

### 1. Coding Questions

#### Question 1: Convert sum(2,6,1) to sum(2)(6)(1)

```javascript
function sum(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

// Curried version
function sum(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return function(c) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }
}
```

**ES6 Arrow Function Version:**
```javascript
const sum = a => b => c => a + b + c;
```

#### Question 2: Infinite Currying - sum(1)(2)(3)(4)...(n)()

```javascript
function sum(a) {
    return function(b) {
        if (b) {
            return sum(a + b);
        }
        return a;
    }
}

console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)()); // 10
```

**How it works:** The function recursively calls itself with the accumulated sum until no argument is passed (empty parentheses), then returns the total.[3][4]

#### Question 3: Implement curry() function

```javascript
function curry(func) {
    return function curried(...args) {
        if (args.length >= func.length) {
            return func.apply(this, args);
        } else {
            return function(...args2) {
                return curried.apply(this, args.concat(args2));
            }
        }
    }
}

// Usage
function sum(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

let curriedSum = curry(sum);
console.log(curriedSum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2, 3)); // 6
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(3)); // 6
```

### 2. Output-Based Questions

#### Question 1: What will this output?

```javascript
function multiply(a) {
    return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
            return a * b * c;
        }
    }
}

let result = multiply(2)(3);
console.log(result); // What will this print?
```

**Answer:** This will print a function, not a number, because the third argument `c` hasn't been provided yet.[5]

#### Question 2: Analyzing currying behavior

```javascript
function add(a) {
    console.log('First function called with:', a);
    return function(b) {
        console.log('Second function called with:', b);
        return function(c) {
            console.log('Third function called with:', c);
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }
}

let result = add(1)(2)(3);
```

**Output:**
```
First function called with: 1
Second function called with: 2
Third function called with: 3
```

### 3. Verbal/Conceptual Questions

#### Question: What is the difference between Currying and Partial Application?

**Currying:**
- Transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument
- Always produces unary (single-argument) functions
- `f(a, b, c)` becomes `f(a)(b)(c)`

**Partial Application:**
- Fixes some arguments of a function and produces another function with fewer arguments
- Can produce functions with multiple arguments
- `f(a, b, c)` with partial application of first argument becomes `f'(b, c)`

```javascript
// Currying
const curriedAdd = a => b => c => a + b + c;

// Partial Application
function partialAdd(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
const addTen = partialAdd.bind(null, 10);
console.log(addTen(5, 3)); // 18
```

#### Question: Why is currying useful?

**Benefits of currying:**[6]
1. **Reusability**: Create specialized functions from general ones
2. **Function composition**: Easier to compose functions together
3. **Partial application**: Apply arguments incrementally
4. **Code modularity**: Break complex functions into simpler parts

### 4. Advanced Questions

#### Question 1: Curry with Placeholder Support

```javascript
function curry(func) {
    return function curried(...args) {
        const sanitizedArgs = args.slice(0, func.length);
        const hasPlaceholder = sanitizedArgs.some(arg => arg === curry.placeholder);
        
        if (!hasPlaceholder && sanitizedArgs.length === func.length) {
            return func.apply(this, sanitizedArgs);
        }
        
        return function(...nextArgs) {
            const combinedArgs = sanitizedArgs.map(
                arg => arg === curry.placeholder && nextArgs.length 
                    ? nextArgs.shift() : arg
            ).concat(nextArgs);
            return curried(...combinedArgs);
        };
    };
}

curry.placeholder = Symbol('_');

// Usage
const join = curry((a, b, c) => `${a}_${b}_${c}`);
const joinWithPlaceholder = join('a', curry.placeholder, 'c');
console.log(joinWithPlaceholder('b')); // "a_b_c"
```

#### Question 2: DOM Manipulation with Currying

```javascript
const updateElemText = id => content => {
    document.querySelector(`#${id}`).textContent = content;
};

// Usage
const updateHeader = updateElemText('header');
updateHeader('New Header Text');

// Or directly
updateElemText('header')('Hello World');
```

### 5. Practical Implementation Questions

#### Question: How does infinite currying work internally?

**Step-by-step execution of sum(1)(2)(3)():**[3]

1. `sum(1)` executes, returns function expecting `b`
2. `sum(1)(2)` executes, returns `sum(3)` (recursive call)
3. `sum(3)(3)` executes, returns `sum(6)` 
4. `sum(6)()` executes with no argument, returns `6`

## Common Interview Patterns

### Pattern 1: Function Transformation
- Convert normal functions to curried versions
- Understand closure mechanics
- Handle variable number of arguments

### Pattern 2: Infinite Arguments
- Recursive currying implementations
- Base case identification (empty arguments)
- Accumulator pattern usage

### Pattern 3: Utility Functions
- Generic curry function implementation
- Placeholder support
- Error handling and edge cases

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Currying transforms functions** - it doesn't call them[2]
2. **Closures enable currying** - inner functions access outer function variables[7]
3. **Each curried function takes one argument** and returns another function[1]
4. **Currying enhances function composition** and reusability[6]
5. **Partial application is different** - it fixes some arguments but may still take multiple arguments[8]
