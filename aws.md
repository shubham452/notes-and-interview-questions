**GitHub Actions** is an automation platform built into GitHub that lets you automate, customize, and execute software development workflows directly in your repositories. It’s most commonly used to implement **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** pipelines, but you can automate almost any task, from testing code and deploying apps to sending notifications or managing issues[1][2][3][4][5].

## How GitHub Actions Works

### 1. **Core Components**
- **Workflows:**  
  An automated process defined in a YAML file (stored in `.github/workflows/` directory). Workflows run in response to specific events—like code pushes, pull requests, or scheduled times. You can have multiple workflows in a repository, each for different tasks[1][2][3][4].

- **Events:**  
  These are triggers that start workflows. Common events include code pushes, pull requests, releases, issue creation, scheduling, or even manual triggers[1][3][4].

- **Jobs:**  
  Each workflow consists of one or multiple jobs. Each job runs in a fresh virtual machine (runner) and can execute steps in sequence or in parallel. For example, you might have a "test" job and a "deploy" job[1][6][3].

- **Steps:**  
  These are individual tasks in a job, such as running a script or executing a specific action. All steps in a job run on the same runner[1][6][3].

- **Actions:**  
  Reusable units of code or commands (such as checking out code, setting up a language runtime, uploading artifacts). Actions are either custom-made or pulled from the GitHub Marketplace to reduce repetitive scripting[1][6][4].

- **Runners:**  
  The servers where jobs are executed. GitHub provides hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS), or you can use your own (self-hosted). Each job is run in a clean environment[1][6][5].

### 2. **How a Typical Workflow Runs (Step by Step)**
1. **Developer triggers an event** (e.g., pushes code, opens a pull request).
2. **GitHub Actions detects** this event and starts the appropriate workflow(s) as defined in `.github/workflows/`.
3. **Workflow executes jobs**, each job running on a separate runner (virtual machine or container).
4. **Each job runs a set of steps**: scripts or reusable actions (like installing dependencies, building code, running tests).
5. **Results are reported** to GitHub’s UI—so you see if builds passed, tests failed, etc.
6. If configured, **jobs can deploy code, notify teams, or automate other tasks** upon success or failure.

### 3. **Typical Use Cases**
- **Test code automatically on pull requests.**
- **Build and deploy applications automatically to staging or production environments.**
- **Send notifications to Slack or email.**
- **Run scheduled tasks (like data backups or code quality checks).**
- **Automate issue and PR management.**

**In summary:**  
GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate software workflows (like build, test, and deploy) directly in your repository. You define workflows using YAML, trigger them on events, and run them as jobs/steps on cloud or self-hosted runners—all tightly integrated with the GitHub ecosystem[1][2][3][5].


Here's how and where developers use the most common AWS (Amazon Web Services) services and tools in real-world scenarios:

## How and Where AWS Services Are Used by Developers

### 1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
- **How:** Developers launch virtual servers (“instances”) to host applications, run backend processes, and set up development/test environments.
- **Where Used:** 
  - Running web APIs, websites, and custom backend applications.
  - Batch processing jobs and data analytics.
  - Hosting game servers or legacy applications.

### 2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
- **How:** Developers use S3 to store and retrieve files, manage backups, and host static assets.
- **Where Used:** 
  - Static website hosting (HTML/CSS/JS).
  - Storing user photos, videos, and documents in social or media apps.
  - Backup and restore operations for business data.

### 3. **AWS Lambda**
- **How:** Runs code in response to events (like HTTP requests, file uploads, or scheduled jobs) without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Where Used:** 
  - Building serverless APIs.
  - Processing images/files after upload.
  - Automating scheduled tasks and data pipelines.

### 4. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**
- **How:** Managed relational database hosting with automated backup, scaling, and patching.
- **Where Used:** 
  - Websites and applications needing a robust SQL database (e.g., e-commerce, ERPs).
  - Analytics platforms and business tools.

### 5. **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **How:** Managed NoSQL database for fast, scalable, and low-latency access.
- **Where Used:**
  - Real-time gaming leaderboards.
  - User session storage for mobile/web apps.
  - IoT device data collection.

### 6. **Amazon API Gateway**
- **How:** Developers define, deploy, and manage secure APIs at scale.
- **Where Used:**
  - Building RESTful or WebSocket APIs for mobile/web clients.
  - Public-facing API services for third-party integration.

### 7. **Elastic Beanstalk**
- **How:** Quickly deploy and manage applications with minimal AWS expertise, automating load balancing, scaling, and monitoring.
- **Where Used:**
  - Startups and small teams deploying web apps or microservices.
  - Staging or sandbox environments for rapid development.

## AWS Developer Tools: How and Where Used

- **CloudFront**: Global content delivery for static/dynamic sites, media streaming, or APIs.
- **IAM**: Securely managing access rights and permissions for users and applications.

## Summary

Developers use AWS services throughout **all phases of development**:
- **Development & Testing:** With tools like Cloud9, local SDKs, and the CLI.
- **Deployment:** Using services such as CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Production:** EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, and supporting tools scale reliably as traffic grows.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Tools like X-Ray, CloudWatch, and IAM help secure and optimize apps long-term.

AWS provides the building blocks for virtually every aspect of modern, scalable application development. Developers choose the right combination of these services depending on project size, architecture, and business needs.
